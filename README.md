# logseq_utils

Note this is currently just the landing page for the utils behind the blog post, https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-06-12-logseq-publish-hugo-with-python/ , for the purposes of publishing a single log-seq page to markdown, along with any block embeds it has, by talking to a local logseq server REST API.
